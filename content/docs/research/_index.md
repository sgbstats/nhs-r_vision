[A mistake in the operating room can threaten the life of one patient; a mistake in statistical analysis or interpretation can lead to hundreds of early deaths. So it is perhaps odd that, while we allow a doctor to conduct surgery only after years of training, we give SPSSÂ® (SPSS, Chicago, IL) to almost anyone. Moreover, whilst only a surgeon would comment on surgical technique, it seems that anybody, regardless of statistical training, feels confident about commenting on statistical data.](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncpuro0294)

The NHS as one of the largest hospital and healthcare systems is a world leader in research.Research comes both as large funded projects and unfunded audits (or similar) both of which often require statistics. Many research projects have clinicians doing their own analysis based on a few undergraduate statistics classes. Most clinicians will not have any experience coding so analysis is often done in SPSS using the point-and-click interface, or worse, Excel. This overall slows down the analysis and makes reproducibility poor. 

Furthermore, many trusts do not have in-house stats teams and will only be able to get stats time on funded work and buying in time from academic/external statisticians. This means that the pilot work that clinicians do prior to applying for large grants can often be floored, or promising work ends up not being completed and the grants never awarded because they didn't have the statistics expertise.

While we would not expect clinicians to become expert coders, NHSRC should work to support training that would get clinicians to be able to use R, including the development/rehashing of training specifically for those with a medical background as well as delivering the training and encouragement of using R and improving data management practices. Regardless of background, those who use R on a day-to-day basis should be able to help those who don't.

It would also be good to see better collaboration between R users in the academic space and those in the trust-level analytics spaces to be able to learn from each other.
